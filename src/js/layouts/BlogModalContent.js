          A High Schooler's Guide to LinkedIn Cold DMs
          <br />
          üëã Hi David - I'm a junior in high school interested in brand strategy and marketing. I noticed your involvement
          with companies like Gemini and would love some insight into student involvement in the industry.
          <br />
          This cold DM was sent 4 months ago and completely changed my life.
          <br />
          After months of looking for a summer internship, my prospects were grim. It was 23 days before school was due to
          end, and I had no summer plans. Over 500 DMs were sent and no results to show for those hours spent browsing
          LinkedIn looking for marketing PMs. Finding a summer internship as a high schooler seemed impossible.
          <br />
          Here are a few tips that helped me crack the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numbers
          <br />
          The first one is simple and applies to a lot of things in life: It‚Äôs a numbers game. Let's say you have a 2.0
          GPA and no prior work experience. Your odds of receiving an internship for the role in the industry you want
          are placed at 0.01%. Even someone with a 2.0 GPA would look at those odds and pass. However, all that % means
          is that it is going to statistically take 10,000 DMs before you get what you‚Äôre looking for. The key here is to
          treat each DM like you‚Äôre a Girl Scout knocking on someone's door to sell them cookies. Your goal is to be
          knocking at the 100th door by the time the 1st even rejects you. The worst case is you waste an hour sending
          10,000 messages and in a few decades you can look back and be like ‚Äúwow I can't believe Bezos passed on me‚Äù üòÇ
          Create a few DM templates:
        </p>
        <p>
          üëãHi ____ - I'm a junior in high school highly interested in student opportunities to make a difference at
          _____. Would love to learn more about the program, so let's connect! - Nirvan
        </p>
        <p>
          üòÉHi ______ - I'm a junior in high school interested in brand strategy and marketing. I noticed your
          involvement with companies like _____ and would love some insight into student involvement in the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          üëãHey Jessica, I‚Äôm a high schooler and stumbled across your LinkedIn profile while looking for internship
          opportunities. Would love to learn about any possible roles for students at ______.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the LinkedIn search bar, paste the company you‚Äôre looking for, tweak the template, and then just copy and
          paste changing the names. You should be able to reach out to multiple people a minute.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Preview
          <br />
          These templates bring me to my next point ‚Äî you have around 10 words to get a point across without the person
          actually opening the DM.
        </p>
        <p>
          I liked using 3 things
          <br />
          Their name ‚Äî the personalization here automatically adds warmth to the conversation and will be eye-catching
          in a sea of DMs
          <br />
          Emojis ‚Äî for this use case, a simple üëã is perfect. It's explanatory, colorful, and eye-catching.
          <br />
          Age ‚Äî If you‚Äôre reading this article you‚Äôre probably on the younger side. It‚Äôs important to leverage your age.
          Recruiters are met by thousands of college graduate candidates. But how many are 14 or 15?
        </p>
        <p>
          Age
          <br />
          As mentioned in the last section, leveraging your age will come in handy as people are generally more inclined
          to help out a younger person. For many, it‚Äôs fun to use your life experience to guide and mold the younger
          generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last tip I have is to scout the profile. If you‚Äôre trying to make a connection to someone who hasn‚Äôt posted
          on their profile in months, you probably won't be receiving any useful advice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next Steps
          <br />
          Once you get a response, from there the easiest thing to do is set up a call. Explain what you're looking for,
          and see if the position available is a good fit for you. Even if there is not a position available, a lot of
          times the recruiter or manager may have some cool tips or random life advice. Regardless of the internship
          status, you should still make an effort to maintain the relationship in case you need any help in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using these tips, I was able to randomly stumble upon the most informative 3 months of my life. I sent a DM to
          a marketing lead at Gemini, and although Gemini was unable to offer me a position, he connected me with Big
          Time Studios, a brand new game studio integrating NFTs into their MMORPG. At the time, they were just launching
          their marketing efforts and were desperate for any help they could get managing the huge influx of demand for
          the game. Working alongside industry leaders like Ari, the founder of Decentraland immersed me in a 360 view of
          the marketing world -- more than any summer course run by Stanford ever could.
