      This cold DM was sent 4 months ago and completely changed my life. 
      
      
      
      
      After months of looking for a summer internship, my prospects were grim. It was 23 days before school was due to end, and I had no summer plans. Over 500 DMs were sent and no results to show for those hours spent browsing LinkedIn looking for marketing PMs. Finding a summer internship as a high schooler seemed impossible. 
      
      
      
      
      Here are a few tips that helped me crack the code. `,

I used a popular website from the lego collecting community, brickseek.com to track down discounts and deals and organize that info in short form consumable posts in a discord group. I started it in January, and by March we had 200 members. At this point, there was no charge to be in the group, however, I monetized the service by offering to post deals in similar groups for a fee. This funded the adventure, and soon I had around 3000 members in my own free group, along with around 25 employees consisting of developers, support team, and social media content curators. We had a suite of monitors for sites like slick deals and forums on Reddit that pinged as soon as deals with important keywords were posted. From here, I monetized once again and decided to offer a monthly subscription membership on a limited basis to those 3000 members to unlock more/better deals. The move was a success, however, personal issues came up and I decided to sell a portion of the brand. I am still an active partner, however, I don‚Äôt commit hours a day to the project. Here are some of the lessons I‚Äôve learned: `,

My issue with today‚Äôs currency and politics, in general, is that there is a lack of transparency. I don‚Äôt know where my tax money specifically goes, I don‚Äôt know if Jeffery Epstein actually killed himself or not, I don‚Äôt know if the media is lying.

      I‚Äôd like to preface this by saying most of the current NFT projects are garbage. Like buying tokenized colors: Who in their right mind would spend 10,000 dollars on singular color? Heading over to BakerySwap‚Äôs new listings, we can check out thousands of more NFT projects that are auctioning for insane prices but in reality, are sometimes actual 3rd grader‚Äôs art projects. I think what is happening here is people are bidding on the technology and novelty rather than the art itself, which results in uber high bids for art that really doesn‚Äôt warrant that price.
